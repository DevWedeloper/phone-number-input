# Core Concepts

This page explains the core concepts and design of the Phone Number Input library.

## What the Library Provides

The library is responsible for:

- Phone number masking and formatting
- Parsing and normalizing phone numbers

It is a **headless** library.  
The library currently supports Angular, with additional framework integrations planned.

## What the Library Does Not Handle

The library does not provide:

- UI components or styling (this is a headless library)
- Country picker UI
